# What's all this then?

Like many software engineering teams—expecially post-COVID—
[Flex](https://getflex.com/)
comprises a diverse workforce all over the world who work remotely, on
different timezones.

## Motivation

We found ourselves asking "what's a good time for you?" too often with
our Melbourne folks and while they are super polite repeating that
they're 16 hours ahead and it's actually tomorrow today, it's clearly
a chore. Also, it's not always true.

In 2022, [Daylight Savings Time in the US]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time_in_the_United_States")
          runs from Match 13 to November 6. But Melbourne, Australia is [ definitely not that](http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/dst_times.shtml).

          So in addition to trying to remember it week-to-week, we have to learn
          it all over again several times a year.
        </Text>
        <Heading>We got you covered</Heading>
        <Text>
          So we made a tool. It's pretty simple to use and gives at-a-glace
          windows of time you can have a conference call. Or call your parents
          in London.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Start by saying what times you're sleeping, working, and playing.
          Playing is any time you're not working or sleeping. We don't need the
          details.
